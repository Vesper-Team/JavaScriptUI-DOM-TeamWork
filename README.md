Backgammon is one of the oldest board games for two players. The playing pieces are moved according to the roll of dice, and a player wins by removing all of their pieces from the board before their opponent. Backgammon is a member of the board games family, one of the oldest classes of board games in the world.
  Backgammon involves a combination of strategy and luck (from rolling dice). While the dice may determine the outcome of a single game, over a series of many games, the better player will accumulate the better record. Thus, records of matches between players are good indicators of relative skill. With each roll of the dice, players must choose from numerous options for moving their checkers and anticipate possible counter-moves by the opponent. 






	



Implementation
The animation of the Menus are made using jQuery and SVG.
The game is developed using JavaScript and some additional frameworks.
 It is used KineticJS to operate with the canvas elements.
The dices are generated with jQuery. It is used a sprite to generate their rolling animation. Their last value is preserved to be used in the program and game logic.
The checkers are also done using KineticJS. They are circle objects with given fill and stroke. They are drawn by functions. As arguments the drawing functions take color of the checker, count of the checkers and their coordinates.
SweetAlert is used for the user game assistance
