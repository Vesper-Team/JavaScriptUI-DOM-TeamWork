			highlight it automatically - change stroke
		} 
		
	// highlight selected piece and draw spooky piece to where it may go
	
	// move selected piece to that spooky piece	
	
	// if - pin {

	}	
	
	// snap it to take its place firmly

			stack pieces
		}
		
	// update event handlers for remaining available pieces to move with the second dice/rest of the dices
	// and darken dice which was used

Congrats!! (player.pieces.Length == 0) WINS!!
